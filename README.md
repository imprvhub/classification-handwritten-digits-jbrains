# classification-handwritten-digits-jbrains
 Experience with the Keras dataset, train a variety of classification algorithms, and find the best one using scikit-learn tools.

In this project, we are going to explore the main classification algorithms and learn how to find and train the best possible model for the classification of handwritten digits. We will need to process a dataset that includes images of handwritten numbers from 0 to 9. The ultimate goal is to train the model to identify a digit on the picture. Sounds interesting? Let's dive into it!
